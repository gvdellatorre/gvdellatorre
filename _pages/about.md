Welcome! I am a historian and educator specializing in postwar American politics, with particular focus on Richard Nixon’s early career and the evolution of mid-century Republican progressivism. My research examines how figures like Nixon and Harold Stassen shaped the ideological realignment of the Republican Party and the broader transformation of American political identity in the mid-twentieth century.

I hold master’s degrees in History and Education and have presented my work at regional and statewide history conferences, including the New Jersey History and Historic Preservation Conference. My scholarship combines archival research with attention to the cultural and social contexts that influenced political behavior and party development in the early Cold War era.

Beyond research, I am deeply committed to teaching and public history. I design classroom materials that connect students with primary sources and help them engage with the complexities of American political change. My broader goal is to make history accessible, analytical, and relevant to understanding the present.
